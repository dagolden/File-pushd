If this is still here it means the programmer was too lazy to create the readme file.

You can create it now by using the command shown below from this directory:

pod2text File::pushd > README

At the very least you should be able to use this set of instructions
to install the module...
perl Build.PL
perl Build
perl Build test
perl Build install
If you are on a windows box you should use 'nmake' rather than 'make'.
